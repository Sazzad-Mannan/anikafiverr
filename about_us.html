            As a child of deaf parents, I am at home in the world of deaf and
            sign language. So early on I thought about working as an
            interpreter, which I pushed aside for a few years. Growing up among
            the deaf, I was able to observe their needs and barriers in everyday
            life very well. I've often acted as an interpreter for smaller
            conversations and was thus able to gain initial experience in the
            professional field. Through traveling around the world, I also came
            into contact with different sign languages ​​in the world and
            learned to converse with these deaf people, albeit in a roundabout
            way. I always try to keep myself up to date with the latest news
            from the deaf world, new gestures, techniques and topics. Through
            preparatory courses, internships and further training, I
            successfully passed the state examination as an interpreter for
            German sign language and spoken language in Nuremberg in March 2017
            and I am very happy to be able to continue to move in the sign
            language community.
